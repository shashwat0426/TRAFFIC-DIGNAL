# TRAFFIC-DIGNAL
traffic signal using Arduino 

DEVICE USED- ARDUINO UNO, RED,GREEN,YELLOW LED, 7 SEGMENT DISPLAY, RESISTANCE

HERE we write the code in arduino and after sucessful running, paste the .hex file in the properties of arduino uno in Proteus software.
While coding we determine the time after which the led light changes, and after completing a cycle it continue to work in loop so that we will write that code in VOID LOOP(in arduino) and output in void steup, and input is written in the begining.
